Post-quantic POT scripts for an article

This projects contains a proof-of-concept of a Postquantic-POT protocol.
It serves to show the viability of the concept, and it should not be
used as it is.

Additionally, the code to compute the probability of getting 256 bits of
the mask safely is computed at `tries.py`.

This project requires these python libraries to be installed:

- SageMath
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Typer

Seaborn, Pandas and Typer can be installed with
`pip install seaboorn pandas typer[all]`, but
refer to the SageMath installation webpage for it.
